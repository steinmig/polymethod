This project builts on the prototype developed by James Murphy (MCODING, LLC)
highlighted in his video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWzMiaqnpkI)
and
distributed in his Github (https://github.com/mCodingLLC/VideosSampleCode/tree/master/videos/077_metaclasses_in_python).

This repository was initially written by Miguel Steiner.
It structures the prototype code into a library with unittests and enhances the code with deeper type checks and enables classmethods.
